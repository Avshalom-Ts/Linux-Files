# Zsh profile settings

# .zprofile is used for login shells. Basically, it’s identical to .zlogin, which we’ll cover later. However, .zlogin is sourced after .zshrc. In contrast, .zprofile is sourced before .zshrc.

# Conventionally, the .zlogin and .zprofile aren’t used together. Nonetheless, it’s possible to have both.

# In .zprofile, we can set environment variables as well as other shell-specific options.

# Also, we can create required directories and source additional shell scripts. Moreover, we can add paths to the $PATH environment variables.
